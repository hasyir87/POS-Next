## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0B4DE) for a clean, luxurious, and calming feel reminiscent of fine fragrances.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, to give a clean, uncluttered and professional feel. The light gray is visually very close to the primary color's hue.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#C4B38A) to highlight key elements such as action buttons and important notifications, conveying a sense of premium quality and elegance.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a clear and legible sans-serif font for body text, ensuring readability on various screen sizes.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif font, for headings to provide an elegant and readable style. Recommendation: pair Playfair (serif) for headlines and PT Sans (sans-serif) for body.
- Use minimalist line icons with a subtle, modern style.
- Emphasize whitespace and a clear, grid-based layout.
